# Pathfinding-algorithm-for-self-driving

PathFinder is a project for finding paths in a 2-dimensional array from one point to another, for example, finding a path for a character in a 2D game. It uses interfaces to make it reusable in many different contexts. 
We have considered 2D-grid of 10X10 size. To start from 'o' to reach '*' come across many paths but A* algorithm would help us to choose shortest path to reach our destination after we past the obstacles on the way. This algorithm prioritizes the node with the lowest f and the best chance of reaching goal.
